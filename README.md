This description provides an overview of the chatbot's capabilities and the technology that powers it, as well as the contents of the repository. You can customize the description to fit your specific chatbot and repository.

## expalination
- prompt: This is a string containing the message that the user has sent to the chatbot. It is used as the input to the chatGPT model when generating a response.

- engine: This is a string specifying the name of the OpenAI engine that will be used to generate the response. In this case, the engine is set to "text-davinci-002", which is a variant of the chatGPT model.

- max_tokens: This is an integer specifying the maximum number of tokens (i.e., words and punctuation) that the chatGPT model should generate in its response. In this case, the value is set to 1024.max limit is 4096

- n: This is an integer specifying the number of responses that the OpenAI API should generate for the given prompt. In this case, the value is set to 1, which means that the API will generate a single response.

- stop: This is a string or list of strings specifying the tokens (i.e., words or punctuation) at which the OpenAI API should stop generating the response. If this parameter is not provided, the API will generate the response until it reaches the maximum number of tokens specified by max_tokens.

- temperature: This is a float value between 0 and 1 specifying the "creativity" or randomness of the chatGPT model's responses. A lower temperature will result in more predictable responses, while a higher temperature will allow the model to generate more varied and creative responses.

Here is a tutorial on how to use chatGPT to build a chatbot:

Install the necessary libraries:
To use chatGPT, you will need to install the OpenAI API and the openai Python library.
